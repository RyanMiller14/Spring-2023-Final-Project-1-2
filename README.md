# Spring-2023-Final-Project-1-2
This was a simple iteration of a tv remote where one can load up to 10 channels and swap through them with working volume functionality. MP4 and WEBM video formats are known to not work, atleast on my system, with AVI format missing audio. WMV video format is the one that I know works for both visual and audio playback and shall be used for the 5 demo channels included.

Library Installations Needed: PyQt5

Must include "channel" files within same directory as either project1_main.py or executable file, whichever is used.
